# /code - Implement from spec tasks

Use this workflow after /spec-tasks.

1. Read .specs/$ARGUMENTS/tasks.md and identify the next pending task.
2. Implement only that task following project standards.
3. Run /test.
4. Run /review.

Preferred flow: /spec-init -> /spec-requirements -> /spec-design -> /spec-tasks -> /code -> /test -> /review
